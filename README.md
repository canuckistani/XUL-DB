#XulDb

This is an old tech demo I wrote in 2008 and used as an example for a talk I gave at PHP Tek 2007. The talk slides somehow ended up on scribd:

*__Warning__! Here be dragons, etc. This probably wont work at all, and definitely isn't very good as a Xul example. It was fun to create at the time though.*
